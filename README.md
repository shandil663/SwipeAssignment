Swipe Assignment ðŸ“±
Swipe Assignment is an Android application that allows users to view and upload product information. The app uses Kotlin and XML to create a smooth user experience. The app fetches products from an API and allows users to upload products, with or without an image, based on network availability.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Core Technologies:
Kotlin: A modern, statically typed language for Android development.
XML: Used for creating user interface layouts.

Architecture:
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): To separate UI logic from business logic, making the app more maintainable.
ViewModel: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
LiveData: Used for data observation to update UI components.

Libraries:
Retrofit: For making HTTP requests to interact with the API.
OkHttp: A powerful HTTP client for sending and receiving network requests.
Gson: A library for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
Koin: A lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
ViewPager2: For adding swipeable tabs and fragments.

UI/UX:
Material Design: Implements Google's Material Design components for modern UI design.
SearchView: For filtering products.
GridLayoutManager: For displaying products in a grid.

Permissions:
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: For accessing images from the device storage.

Networking:
ConnectivityManager: For checking the network status and conditionally uploading products.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
View Products: The ProductListFragment fetches products from the server or local storage and displays them in a RecyclerView.
Upload Products: The UploadProductFragment allows users to fill in product details (name, type, price, tax) and upload an image. If the network is available, the product is uploaded to the server; otherwise, it is saved locally.
Network Handling: The app checks network availability before attempting to upload data.
